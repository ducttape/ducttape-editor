Ducttape Editor
===============
A scene editor in Qt4 for the Ducttape Engine with scripting integration.

Documentation
-------------
A manual on how to use the editor will be created at a later point.

Cloning
-------
If you clone this using the usual `git clone git://github.com/ducttape/ducttape-editor.git`
please run `git submodule update --init --recursive` as the first thing you do 
within the cloned repo.
Alternatively, you can just clone with `git clone --recursive`.
This will get our externals that are in different git repos to keep this one
clean and dandy.

Building
